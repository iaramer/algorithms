**Inline Question 1**

Notice the structured patterns in the distance matrix, where some rows or columns are visible brighter.
(Note that with the default color scheme black indicates low distances while white indicates high distances.)

- What in the data is the cause behind the distinctly bright rows?
- What causes the columns?

The answer:

- The high difference between the given sample and all other samples.
- There are no similar samples in the test set.



**Inline Question 2**

We can also use other distance metrics such as L1 distance.
For pixel values $p_{ij}^{(k)}$ at location $(i,j)$ of some image $I_k$,

the mean $\mu$ across all pixels over all images is $$\mu=\frac{1}{nhw}\sum_{k=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^{h}\sum_{j=1}^{w}p_{ij}^{(k)}$$
And the pixel-wise mean $\mu_{ij}$ across all images is
$$\mu_{ij}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^np_{ij}^{(k)}.$$
The general standard deviation $\sigma$ and pixel-wise standard deviation $\sigma_{ij}$ is defined similarly.

Which of the following preprocessing steps will not change the performance of a Nearest Neighbor classifier that uses L1 distance? Select all that apply.
1. Subtracting the mean $\mu$ ($\tilde{p}_{ij}^{(k)}=p_{ij}^{(k)}-\mu$.)
2. Subtracting the per pixel mean $\mu_{ij}$  ($\tilde{p}_{ij}^{(k)}=p_{ij}^{(k)}-\mu_{ij}$.)
3. Subtracting the mean $\mu$ and dividing by the standard deviation $\sigma$.
4. Subtracting the pixel-wise mean $\mu_{ij}$ and dividing by the pixel-wise standard deviation $\sigma_{ij}$.
5. Rotating the coordinate axes of the data.

The answer:

1, 2



**Inline Question 3**

Which of the following statements about $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$-NN) are true in a classification setting, and for all $k$? Select all that apply.
1. The decision boundary (hyperplane between classes in feature space) of the k-NN classifier is linear.
2. The training error of a 1-NN will always be lower than that of 5-NN.
3. The test error of a 1-NN will always be lower than that of a 5-NN.
4. The time needed to classify a test example with the k-NN classifier grows with the size of the training set.
5. None of the above.

The answer:

1, 4
